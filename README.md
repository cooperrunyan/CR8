## Registers

| Number | Name | Size  | Description          |
| ------ | ---- | ----- | -------------------- |
| 0      | `A`  | 8-bit | GP - arg 0           |
| 1      | `B`  | 8-bit | GP - arg 1           |
| 2      | `C`  | 8-bit | GP - arg 2           |
| 3      | `D`  | 8-bit | GP - arg 3           |
| 4      | `Z`  | 8-bit | GP - return          |
| 5      | `L`  | 8-bit | Low index byte       |
| 6      | `H`  | 8-bit | High index byte      |
| 7      | `F`  | 8-bit | Flags / Intermediate |

> `F` Is commonly used as an intermediate register in `std` macros, meaning
> certain macros will overwrite its state.

### Flags

- 0: `LF`: Less than flag
- 1: `EF`: Equal to flag
- 2: `CF`: Carry
- 4: `BF`: Borrow

### System Registers

| Name  | Size  | Description          |
| ----- | ----- | -------------------- |
| `PCL` | 8-bit | Program counter LOW  |
| `PCH` | 8-bit | Program counter HIGH |
| `SPL` | 8-bit | Stack pointer LOW    |
| `SPH` | 8-bit | Stack pointer HIGH   |
| `MB`  | 8-bit | Memory Bank          |

## Instructions

> - 0x00 is effectively a `NOP` because it moves A to A
> - `JNZ` with the is-imm bit set to 1 is effectively `JMP`

> `*`: Updates FLAG register

### Instruction Layout

- Instructions are 2-3 bytes long.
- First byte of the instruction looks like `OOOOIRRR`, where:
  - `I`: Is-immediate?
  - `O`: Operation
  - `R`: Register value

## Memory Layout

| Start Address | End Address | Size  | Purpose                  |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----- | ------------------------ |
| `0x0000`      | `0x7FFF`    | 32Kb  | ROM                      |
| `0x8000`      | `0xBFFF`    | 16Kb  | Banked RAM               |
| `0xC000`      | `0xFBFF`    | ~13Kb | GP RAM                   |
| `0xFC00`      | `0xFEFF`    | ~2Kb  | Stack + Psuedo-registers |

### Memory Banks

- `0x00`: Builtin-memory
- `0x01`: VRAM
- `...`: Extensible

## Devices

Up to 256 devices can be connected at once. A device can either `send` a byte to
the system or `receive` a byte from the system.

### `0x00`: SysCtrl - _BUILTIN_

- `0x00`: `PING` - Ping the controller.
- `0x01`: `HALT` - Stop the clock.
- `0x02`: `PEEK` - Peek into memory. The next two messages to `SysCtrl` are the
  address's low-byte, followed by it's high-byte.
- `0x03`: `DBG` - Debug the system's register state.

### `0x01`: Keyboard

- Stores state for 8 keys. Stores keys' pressed-state in 1 byte.
- Currently does not support receiving information.
- If it is asked to `send` it will flush its state to the receiver.
- When a key is pressed, it sets its corresponding bit into the state, which is
  stored until it is flushed.
- Key bit number (Can be modified):
  - `0`: `↑`
  - `1`: `↓`
  - `2`: `←`
  - `3`: `→`
  - `4`: `spacebar`
  - `5`: `r`
  - `6`: `+`
  - `7`: `-`

## Macros

Instruction-set is extremely minimal but the assembler offers extensibility with
rust-inspired macros. See `asm/std` for the `std` library which contains macros
and other functions.

```asm
#macro jnz {
    ; Capture the use of `jnz arg0, arg1` where
    ; arg0 is a static, two-byte value and
    ; arg1 is either a static, one-byte value or a register
    ($addr: imm16, $if: imm8 | reg) => {
        mov %l, $addr.l    ; Move low-byte of $addr into %l
        mov %h, $addr.h    ; Move high-byte of $addr into %h
        jnz $if
    }

    ; Additional capture arm
    () => {
        ...
    }
}
```

> This is a snippet from `<std>/macro/jmp` that extends the native `jnz`
> instruction to also support known addresses (Instead of only being able to
> jump to `HL`).
